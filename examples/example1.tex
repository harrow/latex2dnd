% example2.dndspec: gravity formula
%
% This is an edX drag-and-drop problem defined using a "dndspec" file,
% a plain-text representation which is easily edited.
% 
% Some properties of this specification:
% - Note spaces around every label in the tex expression.
% - The check formula also has spaces around each label.
% - Labels are presented in the order specified in the ALL_LABELS line
% - Lines starting in '%' are comments; blank lines are disregarded.
%
% Compile this into the *.xml and *.png files needed, using
% latex2edx filename.dndspec
%
